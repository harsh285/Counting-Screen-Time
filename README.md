# Face-recognition-from-video
count duration for each and every cast in movie(Hera Pheri(1976)) by using pre-trained model facenet and classification by SVM model.


## Prerequisites

  ### Download From Google Drive
  
   Download pre-trained Keras FaceNet model , haarcascade file for face detection and  Dataset For Face Recognition.and Put this .h5 model and Dataset in Directory where your .py files are.

## `Excute Program .py File`
    
####  `Open Pre_Process.py`
     Run This File first it will take Few minits.it will generate "faces-dataset.npz" file
####  `Open embedding.py`
     second Run This File and it will genarate "faces-embeddings.npz".
####  `Open Classification.py` 
     Last Run This File It will Give You predictive output from taking random images from Test Set.
####  `Open MainVideo.py` 
      It will scanned and recognized each and every faces in each and every fmares than count duration for cast by using trained model.
